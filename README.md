# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction App

A **Streamlit-based web application** for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using a trained machine learning model.  
This project demonstrates the **complete ML pipeline**: data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Project Overview** — Introduction to the app and dataset.
- **Data Exploration** — View dataset shape, columns, sample data, and filter records.
- **Visualization** — Interactive charts:
  - Histograms
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Scatter plots
- **Model Prediction** — Input patient details to get:
  - Prediction: Diabetic / Non-Diabetic
  - Prediction probability
- **Model Performance** — Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The app uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**:
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Target Variable:** `Outcome` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)
- **Features:**
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age

## 🚀 Deployment

This project can be deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**:

1. Push your code to a public GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and log in.
3. Select your repository, branch, and entry point (`app.py`).
4. Deploy and share the public URL.

---

## 📈 Model Training

The model was trained using:

* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Train-Test Split:** 80%-20%
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Preprocessing steps included replacing invalid zero values with the median for:
`Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`.

If you want, I can **also add a “Quick Start” section** in the README that will auto-download the dataset if missing, so your app always works when someone clones it from GitHub.  
Do you want me to add that?
